# Our Impact - Front-end

By Diego Quintanilla

Front-end setup for Our Impact project which will render information from project back-end with the use of `React` and `Bootstrap`.

**NOTE:** This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Technologies Used

## Description

Front-end logic that will be displayed via `React.js`. Registeration of users along with new comments or updating, deleting information will all be done via `async/await` methods that will communicate with the server routes on the back-end.

Front-end will also store a user's auth token in `localStorage` for their browser so that this information can be sent to the back-end server routes to authenticate a user.
